Hey All,

I was asked to provide code for the case study.  I didn't originally use Python to complete the analysis in the case study.
I spent some time replicating the tables that are displayed in my PowerPoint presentation using Python.
At the end of the Python file there is a simple function that allows the user to select a slide (numbered 1-6) to print.

*DTA 30 day Bucket tables and The Appendix Tables were not replicated in the file

Cheers!
